with open('input.txt', 'w') as f:
  f.write("this is the first line")
  f.write("this is the second line")
  f.write("this is the third line")
  f.write("this is the forth line")
  f.write("this is the fifth line")

with open('input.txt', 'r'):
  content = f.read()

# for word count
word_count = len(content.split())

# for uppercase conversion
uppercase_content  = content.upper()

with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
  f.write(uppercase_content)
  f.write(f"the word count is: {word_count}")

print("congratulation writing and conversion done")
