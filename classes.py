'''
Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️
Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.
Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). 
However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗,
while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).

class man():
  def __init__(self, animal_type, speak):
    self.speaking() = speak
    self.animal_type() = type
  
  def display_details():
    print("the animal type is: {self.animal_type}, and it speaking form is {self.speaking}")
